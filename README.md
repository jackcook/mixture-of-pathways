# Mixture of Pathways

_Studying brain-like processing pathways with heterogeneous mixture-of-experts models. ðŸ§ _

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Model training

To train one of our standard multi-task models on all tasks in the [Mod-Cog task suite](https://github.com/mikailkhona/Mod_Cog), you may simply run our `run_experiment` script:

```bash
python -m cli.run_experiment
```

The command above will set your PyTorch device to `cuda` by default.
If you don't have access to a machine with an NVIDIA GPU, you have three options:

```bash
# Train using CPU
python -m cli.run_experiment --device cpu

# Train using MPS on macOS (experimental support)
python -m cli.run_experiment --device mps

# Train on Modal (https://modal.com)
python -m cli.run_experiment --modal
```

### Single-task models

To train a model on a single task, you must specify the task name.
For example:

```bash
python -m cli.run_experiment --task-id modcog/dm1
```

For a full list of task names, see Figure 14 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02813), or [pathways/task.py](pathways/task.py#L52).

### Other model options

All hyperparameters are documented if you run:

```bash
python -m cli.run_experiment --help
```

A couple notable ones are:

- `--cost-based-loss-alpha`: $\alpha$ from Equation 2 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02813).
- `--dropout-max-prob`: $\beta$ from Equation 3 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02813).
- `--dropout-router-weight-threshold`: $\gamma$ from Equation 3 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02813).
- `--layers` (`-l`): Comma-separated lists of expert sizes for each layer, with 0 denoting a skip connection. Should be passed multiple times to specify multiple layers. For example, `-l 0,32,64 -l 0,32,64 -l 0,32,64` is our default model with three layers, each of which has one skip connection, one expert with 32 hidden units, and one expert with 64 hidden units.
- `--num-epochs`: Number of epochs to train for. Defaults to 10.

More documentation will be provided soon!
